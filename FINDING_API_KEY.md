# How to Find Your Scraper.Tech API Key

## If You Don't See an API Key

The API key is only available **after you subscribe** to the service. Here's how to find it:

### Step 1: Subscribe First
1. Go to the "Download All in One!" API page
2. Click **"Pricing"** (in the navigation bar)
3. Choose a plan and subscribe
4. Complete payment if required

### Step 2: Find Your API Key

After subscribing, try these locations:

1. **My Services Page:**
   - Click "My Services" in the top navigation bar
   - Find "Download All in One!" in your list
   - Click on it to see API key details

2. **Account Dashboard:**
   - Go to your account/profile settings
   - Look for "API Keys" or "Credentials" section
   - Your API keys should be listed there

3. **API Playground:**
   - Sometimes the API key is shown in the Playground interface
   - Look for a key icon or "API Key" field
   - It might be in the request headers section

4. **Service Details:**
   - Go to Marketplace → Download All in One
   - If subscribed, there might be a "Credentials" or "API Key" tab
   - Check all tabs/sections on the API page

### Step 3: If Still Can't Find It

1. **Check Email:**
   - Scraper.Tech might have sent the API key via email after subscription
   - Check your inbox/spam folder

2. **Contact Support:**
   - Use the "Ticket system" link in the Contacts dropdown
   - Ask them where to find your API key for "Download All in One!" API

3. **Check Documentation:**
   - Click "Docs" in the top navigation
   - Look for authentication/API key setup instructions

## Alternative: Test Without API Key First

You can test the service without the API key - it will fall back to ytdl-core (though that may be blocked by YouTube). Once you get the API key, add it to Railway for reliable extraction.
